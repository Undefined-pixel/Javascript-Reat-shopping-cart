# 🛒 Shopping Cart

This project was created as part of the **Galavernize training / bootcamp / course**.  
It is a **React application** that demonstrates the basic functionality of a modern shopping cart.

The project originally comes from my old GitHub account **[@redrebelsheep](https://github.com/redrebelsheep)**  
and was developed together with **Chessinator**.
